- choosing rxjs (RX /reactive programming) over channels for now because of the more rich & comprehensible api
 * it was a very close tie, and as pointed out by many people smarter than me "you can implement RX with channels"
 * I do not have the time(sadly) to spend time on implementing a "sugar" layer/helpers but will consider switching in the future

- why choose any of them ?
  - clairty of processes  and the flow of data (my brain craves structure)
  - reusability of code snipets
  - heck , less code too !
